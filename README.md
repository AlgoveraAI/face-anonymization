# 💸 Algovera: Algorithms for Detecting and Anonymizing Faces

This is a collaboration with DataUnion to develop a face anonymisation algorithm. 

## Who is DataUnion?
DataUnion creates data unions to crowdsource datasets and give ownership to the data creators, annotators and verifiers. Unlike platforms like Amazon Mechanical Turk where contributors are paid a small amount per image, DataUnion instead gives contributors the option to co-own the machine-learning-ready dataset. The contributors can exchange these shares (datatokens) for a stable currency, they can stake the datatokens to get continuous rewards when the dataset is being sold, or they can hold on to the tokens in the expectation that the value of the dataset will increase with future R&D. The created dataset is listed and made available for purchase on a marketplace such as Ocean. Here, investors who think the dataset has value and utility can purchase the datatoken, stake into the dataset, or earn interest by exchanging data tokens with other currencies.

## Why is this important?
Distributing ownership of a dataset among creators prevents one centralised party from controlling it. In this framework, the value of any algorithms built on top of the dataset can flow back to the community rather than a single entity. Furthermore, the algorithms themselves (or maybe even the apps built on top) can be owned by the community. We are getting close to an [ImageNet moment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17493090) for AI in Web3. For the first time, we can implement a Proof of Concept for decentralized AI - one that is created and controlled by the community rather than Big Tech.
